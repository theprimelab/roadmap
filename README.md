# Prime Lab Roadmap

This repo covers all public plans for the prime lab, and also serves as a place to officially document student suggestions. If you want to make a suggestion for the lab, please create a new issue by [clicking here](https://github.com/theprimelab/roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggestion.md&title=Suggestion). We will try to respond to all suggestions, but don't take anything here as confirmation of new things coming to the lab unless it is explicitly stated.
