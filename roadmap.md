# Road Map

This is a rough list of things we want to get for / do with the Prime Lab. All of this is subject to change and isn't final.

## Key

***High priority*** - These items are being actively persued and we have made some progress towards getting them.

*Medium priority* - These items are being researched, but no work has been done to add them to the lab.

Low priority - These items are being considered, but could either be removed or drastically changed before they make it into the lab.

## Equipment

- ***Cleanbox/VR Setup*** - We are currently trying to buy a Cleanbox, but it needs to be approved by the department head first.
- ***Prusa MMU2S*** - This is already assembled and installed on the Prusa, but it currently isn't working.
- ***Soldering stations*** - We have one in the office, with a bunch of other equipment, it will be moved down to the lab later in the semester.
- *Workstation VMs* - We will most likely build some more powerful computers for the lab, but we haven't figured out how to handle giving out sudo.
- Machine Learning - Some students have expressed interest in high end machine learning equipment.
- Reflow oven - This would be considered if a student had a project that required one.
- SLA 3D Printer - This might not be entirely realistic for the time being.

## Room setup

- ***Octoprint*** - This is already a WIP, it just needs cleaning up. There may be some other changes to the 3D printing setup that help get this done.
- ***Whiteboard*** - We have a whiteboard on the way! We are working on getting installation sorted out.

## Services

- ***Locker checkouts*** - Reetik is currently working on automating the lockers in the lab for easy checkouts.
- ***Project grants*** - This is a top priority, but we need to work out some core funding details in the lab before we can implement this.
- ***Documentation*** - The documentation repo exists, but should be getting updated soon to make it into a sort of wiki for the lab.
- *Remote VM Solution* - This requires a Citrix license, which is currently only held by the INEG department.
