# Road Map

This is a rough list of things we want to get for / do with the Prime Lab. All of this is subject to change and absolutely not final.

## Key

***High priority*** - These items are being actively persued and we have made some progress towards getting them.

*Medium priority* - These items are being researched, but no work has been done to add them to the lab.

Low priority - These items are being considered, but could either be removed or drastically changed before they make it into the lab.

*Items are not listed in order of priority outside of the catagories*

## Equipment

- ***Cleanbox/VR Setup*** - The purchase of the Cleanbox is going to be dependant on the outcome of the next town hall.
- ***Whiteboard/Corkboard combo*** - A model has been selected and we are working on getting quotes.
- ***Prusa MMU2S*** - This is already assembled and installed on the Prusa, but it currently isn't working.
- *CNC* - Whatever we look at should be capable of handling aluminum.
- *PCB Printer* - Should be multilayer capable.
- *SLA 3D Printer* - Preferrably high volume and useful for testing tolerances.
- *Workstation VMs* - Waiting for 5000 series Threadripper before fully evaluating
- Pick and place machine - Would come after a PCB printer is purchased and has been used.
- Soldering stations
- Reflow oven

## Room setup

- ***Octoprint + Steamlined slicing pipeline*** - This is already a WIP, it just needs cleaning up.

## Services

- ***Locker checkouts*** - Reetik is currently working on automating the lockers in the lab for easy checkouts. 
- ***Secret Project*** - Details are currently being worked out, but this one will be worth it.
- *Remote VM Solution* - Nothing can be done about this until workstation VMs are sorted out
